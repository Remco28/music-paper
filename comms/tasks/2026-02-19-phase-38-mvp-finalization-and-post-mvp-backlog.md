# Task Spec: BTT Phase 38 - MVP Finalization and Post-MVP Backlog

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Owner:** Architect
**Status:** SPEC READY

## Objective
Close the MVP implementation cycle with explicit finalization status, remaining release gates, and a structured post-MVP backlog.

## Rationale
Phase 37 established RC freeze and pending environment/benchmark gates. Phase 38 should package this into a definitive handoff artifact.

## In Scope
- Create finalization document with conditional sign-off status.
- Capture post-MVP backlog priorities.
- Update manifest/docs references for phase closure.

## Out of Scope
- Closing pending benchmark/environment gates themselves.
- New runtime features.

## Required File Changes
- `docs/mvp-finalization-2026-02-19.md` (new)
- `docs/post-mvp-backlog.md` (new)
- `project-manifest.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Finalization status is explicit (`CONDITIONALLY READY` vs `FINAL READY`).
2. Pending gates map directly to RC report/release checklist.
3. Post-MVP backlog is prioritized and actionable.
