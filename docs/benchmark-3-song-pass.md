# Three-Song Benchmark Pass

Use this worksheet to evaluate MVP readiness on three teacher-approved songs.

## Rules
- Use exactly 3 songs approved by the teacher.
- Use single-video YouTube input or local file input (no playlists).
- Record one completed run per song (reruns allowed, but capture the final judged run).

## Pass Criteria
All criteria must pass:
1. 3/3 benchmark runs complete successfully (ZIP produced and downloadable).
2. No unresolved blocker-level issues in outputs/workflow.
3. Teacher judges at least 3/3 runs as usable for rehearsal baseline.

## Severity Definitions
- `blocker`: unusable output or broken workflow for intended use.
- `major`: usable with significant manual correction.
- `minor`: usable with small cleanup.
- `note`: observation only.

## Benchmark Table

| Song | Source Type (`local`/`youtube`) | Source Ref (filename or URL id) | Run ID | ZIP Filename | Profile | Simplify | Warnings (count/category) | Usable (`yes/no`) | Issues (severity + short text) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Song 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Song 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Song 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Verification Checklist (per Song)
- [ ] Run completed and ZIP downloaded.
- [ ] ZIP contains conductor PDF, expected part PDFs, full-score MusicXML, and `manifest.json`.
- [ ] Manifest run metadata matches observed run (`run_id`, options, outcome).
- [ ] Any warnings reviewed and dispositioned (acceptable vs action required).
- [ ] Teacher usability decision recorded.
