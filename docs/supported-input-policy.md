# Supported Input Policy (Teacher App)

## Purpose
Increase classroom success rate by intentionally narrowing scope to songs and output levels we can support reliably.

## Supported Output Levels
- `Beginner`
- `Easy Intermediate`

The teacher app does not expose advanced profiles.

## Supported Song Types (Current Target)
- Pop
- Pop ballad
- Light acoustic
- Simple rock

## Not Targeted (for now)
- Dense jazz harmony / advanced chromatic writing
- Rap-heavy tracks with sparse pitched melody
- EDM with heavy layered synth design
- Metal / prog / highly dense mixes
- Orchestral/cinematic dense textures

## User-Facing Guidance
- If a song is outside target scope, app should warn before export that beginner-friendly output is unlikely.
- Teacher should be encouraged to try a more suitable song when fit is poor.

## Notes
- This policy is for production teacher workflow only.
- Tuning Lab can still test broader material to improve robustness over time.
